# My Portfolio

Welcome to my single-page portfolio! This project showcases my skills and projects using HTML, CSS (with BEM methodology), JavaScript, MixItUp for filtration operations, and the AOS (Animate on Scroll) library for animations. The portfolio is fully responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

This portfolio website offers a dark mode feature and theme customization options, allowing users to personalize their viewing experience. Users can switch between light and dark modes and customize the color theme of the portfolio according to their preferences.
